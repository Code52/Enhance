### Getting started

**Getting started with Git and GitHub**

 * [Forking a GitHub repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
 * [The simple gude to GIT guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/)

Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, clone the repository and run the ```.\build.cmd``` script to compile the code and run all the unit tests. You can use this script to test your changes quickly.
